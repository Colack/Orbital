Here it is, the official mirror of the original Orbital code.

# Information

Orbital is a Discord-JS (v12) bot that I was originally working on in Summer 2021.
The but shut down due to server management and coding issues. 
The code is now avaiable for you to take. Do whatever you want with it.



# Installation

To run the bot, you will first need NodeJS installed on your computer.
You can find NodeJS at 'https://nodejs.org/en/'.

You also need to install the following NPM packages:
  - Axios
  - Express
  - Discord.js (v12)
  - @iamtraction/google/translate.



# Custom Commands

To create custom commands, you will need to enter the './Commands' directory.
Inside of this directory are multiple folders, the folder names are the different types of commands that the bot has.
Enter the folder that describes your command the best, or just make a folder.

You will then just need to make a '.js' file. Follow the template in the './commands/temp/command_template.txt' file.
```
